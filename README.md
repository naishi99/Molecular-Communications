# Molecular Communications-Model based and Data-driven Receiver Design
We worked in the domain of molecular communications as a part of project in Wireless Communications course.

We firstly reproduced the results(both analytical and simulation) of the reference article and then improved upon its proposed work by suggesting innovation in it.

We did literature review as a part of innovation process on the topics such as vesicle based propagation, channel impulse response for passive receiver and enzymatic degradation.

We also implemented LSTM model to compare with the existing ANN model as a part of data-driven approach.
